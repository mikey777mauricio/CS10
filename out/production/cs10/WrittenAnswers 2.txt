1. Separate chaining handles collision by adding each duplicate hash key into a linked list.
The advantages are that it can handle a load higher than the size of the list. Also, it minimizes
clusters. The disadvantage is that it may lead to memory fragmentation due the linked lists.
Lastly, items are easily removable.
Linear Probing is when collisions are handled by inserting the duplicate hash key into the next
available slot. When items are removed, the slot is marked as "deleted", when inserting "deleted" slots
are accounted as full and thus insertion method skips over slot. The disadvantages are that linear probing
cannot handle a load factor higher than 1. Also, too many "deleted" indexes causes the search time to
get closer to linear.

3. Size = 11, hashFunction() = i % 10, elements: 2, 12, 3, 13. For linear probing
one can double the list size and change hashFunction to i % 21;
